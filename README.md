![Libre BusTO](http://bustorino.reyboz.it/bus-torino/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

**BusTO** gives you arrival times for all public transport in *Turin* and its outskirts. Type in the number of the bus stop and get all the information about scheduled and real arrival times of every 5T/GTT's vehicle stopping there.

* Search by number
* Search by name
* Position suggestions
* Save favorite stops

And not obviously:
* No binary files
* No tracking
* No ads
* Fairly light
