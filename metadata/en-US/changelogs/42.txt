For this version we thank Niccol√≤ Marcucci and Solom Mimmo for their fantastic feedback!

* new setting: you can now choose whether to launch the app from favorites/map/lines or arrivals (default)
* fix in the lines screen: now going back to lines does not reset the screen and everything remains as it was before you left it
* we are migrating some menu items from the hamburger menu to the side menu
